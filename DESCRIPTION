Description: listenr contains functions for training echo-state networks (ESNs)
  and implementing explainability methods for "listening to the echo". The 
  code in listenr for training ESN models is based on the code in the R package
  STRbook (https://github.com/andrewzm/STRbook/tree/master) assocated with the
  book Spatio-Temporal Statistics With R 
  (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2020.1865066) by 
  Christopher K. Wikle, Andrew Zammit-Mangion, and Noel Cressie.
